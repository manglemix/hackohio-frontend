        &emsp;&emsp;We are a team of three participating in the <b>Hack OHI/O 11 Hackathon</b>.
        Our main goal is to improve the sustainability of our society one step at a time.
        The specific way we decided to contribute was by tackling the ever present issue of
        <em>littering</em>.
        <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Everyone is be able to see the amount of litter invading their neighborhood.
        The real problem is that its not as easy to take action against it. Litter is persistent,
        and without district or federal level changes, it will remain. Bringing about this kind
        of change does not come easy, and always requires reliable evidence to make a case. This
        is where we come in!
